# Learning SQL with Mode Analytics
In my journey to become a Data Scientist/Analyst, I’ve come to realize that SQL is an essential industry skill. Since I didn’t get much exposure to it during college, I’ve decided to take the initiative to learn it on my own.

There are countless free and paid resources available to learn SQL. I spent a good amount of time exploring them, but a piece of advice from a video by Data Scientist and YouTuber Igor Howell stuck with me: don’t waste too much time searching for the “perfect” resource—just pick one and start learning. That mindset really helped me move forward.

I chose to follow Mode Analytics’ SQL tutorial for Data Analysis, which is divided into four sections: Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, and Analytics Training. In this blog-style repository, I’ll share what my reflections on what I learn from each section as well as the practice problems I work on.
