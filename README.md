# Learning SQL for Data Analysis with Mode Analytics

In my journey to become a Data Scientist and Analyst, I’ve come to realize that SQL is a foundational industry skill. Since I didn’t get much exposure to it during college, I decided to take the initiative to learn it on my own.

There are countless free and paid resources available to learn SQL. I spent some time exploring them, but one piece of advice from Data Scientist and YouTuber **Igor Howell** stuck with me:  
> *“Don’t waste too much time searching for the perfect resource—just pick one and start learning.”*

That mindset helped me move forward with confidence.

I chose to follow [Mode Analytics’ SQL Tutorial for Data Analysis](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial), which is structured into four sections:
- **Basic SQL**
- **Intermediate SQL**
- **Advanced SQL**
- **Analytics Training**

This blog-style repository documents what I learn in each section. It includes:
- Reflections and summaries of key SQL concepts  
- Annotated SQL queries from practice problems  
- Personal notes on what trips me up, what clicks, and what I want to revisit

## Why This Repo Exists

- To **solidify my understanding** of SQL by writing, not just watching or reading  
- To **build a public record** of progress that recruiters, mentors, or future collaborators can see  
- To **connect what I learn** to real-world data analysis workflows

## Repo Structure

Each Markdown file (`.md`) corresponds to a tutorial section:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `basic.md` | SELECT, FROM, WHERE, LIMIT, and basic filtering logic |
| `intermediate.md` | GROUP BY, HAVING, JOINs, CASE statements, and nested logic |
| `advanced.md` | Subqueries, window functions, CTEs, and performance tuning |
| `analytics.md` | Applied SQL techniques for cohort analysis, funnel metrics, and time-based slicing |
